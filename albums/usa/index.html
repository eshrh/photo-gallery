I noticed this interesting orange blob near one of the main highways from our car, and went out to take a photo of it later. On closer inspection (and google translate) the text in the top left, "fuera gringos" roughly translates to "out, foreigners." The irony of taking a photo of the graffiti, laughing about it, and then posting it to my photography site isn't lost on me.</p></span></a>

The Puente dos Hermanos is one of three main bridges connecting the urban sprawl of the majority of San Juan to the historic district of Old San Juan. While San Juan itself (especially Santurce) is mostly residential in nature, Old San Juan is dominated by cruise terminals, hotel complexes, and tourist traps.</p></span></a>

Visited with my family after I finished my spring semester. Unfortunately, it rained nearly every day we were there which is why all my photos look a bit dark and gloomy. All of PR had some really interesting graffiti that kept drawing my attention no matter where I went. Aibonito is along the PR scenic route that passes through the inland, mountainous region of the island. Our rental car got a bit damaged, with some metal parts underneath the front bumper scraping against the road as we drove. As fire became a real concern, we jacked the car up on the side of road with the help of a kind stranger and ripped the piece out (but saved it to return to Hertz). As we stopped to eat and look around, it started pouring again, flooding the road as we drove down the mountain.</p></span></a>

Apparently, it's the oldest and largest aviation museum in the world - and it's certainly super impressive. I visited after participating in the Air Force Research Lab's SDR challenge, where my team presented a demo of SDR ranging using phase information. There are some really remarkable exhibits there, like some presidential airplanes, record setting experimental planes, and many, many fighter jets. It really makes you think about the American capacity for building insane feats of engineering in insanely short periods of time; I don't think this capacity still exists today.</p></span></a>

Classic false advertising flaunts 350k cherry trees without mentioning that those trees are spread out through the entire county. Really only one street (3rd street) had blossoms rivaling japan, which is where I took this photo. We also visited Mercer (a women's methodist university), which has an admittedly cute campus and lake behind it.</p></span></a>

I think feelings against cop city are particularly intense because it brings up two issues that liberal atlanta residents get really angry about: police militarization and brutality, and deforestation/urban sprawl.</p></span></a>

I rode the brightline on Dec 31st from orlando airport station to miamicentral with my sister to meet cousins for new year's. I was really happy to get to ride it not even half a year since service began to MCO...it's still absolutely crazy that my hometown is the one place in the entire USA that gets reasonably fast trains outside the northeast-corridor -- I think that the main reason it's here is tourism, there aren't very many places like florida where three cities (tampa, orlando, miami) get this much tourism and are so close together. In any case, I was really impressed with both the terminal stations and the train itself... the seats were very comfortable and the whole experience was better than an airplane in pretty much every way. When I rode the train, the windows were covered in advertising wrap, ruining the view from the inside, but I've read that they're planning to remove it soon.</p></span></a>
