This is source code for my [[https://photos.esrh.me][photo gallery]] where I post some analog
photographs.

All the heavy lifting is done using photoswipe.

Image html is generated using `site.mts`, which is written in my fork
of [[https://janet-lang.org/][janet]], [[https://github.com/eshrh/matsurika][matsurika]]. I added the function to generate html from lisp
s-exps to the language itself while writing this program to make it
cuter.

`site.mts` also serves as a photo importer that polls for image
metadata and stores it into a json file when called with a file
argument.
